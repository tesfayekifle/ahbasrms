			<p>Antsokiya Heyiwote Berhan Academy stands proudly as one of the premier educational institutions in the Sidama Regional State, located in the vibrant city of Hawassa, near Addisu Gebeya in the Tabor Subcity. Formerly known as Sister Tezeru, the academy underwent a transformative renaming to reflect its commitment to enlightenment and community service.

Our school has achieved remarkable success, emerging as the top-performing academy in the region for two consecutive years. This accolade is a testament to the dedication of our students, educators, and the supportive community that surrounds us.

We are committed to providing a nurturing and inclusive learning environment for students ranging from nursery through grade 8. Our curriculum is designed to inspire creativity, critical thinking, and a lifelong love of learning.

At Antsokiya Heywote Berhan Academy, we believe in empowering the next generation through quality education, fostering not only academic excellence but also personal growth and social responsibility. Join us in our mission to illuminate minds and build a brighter future for the community!</p>
